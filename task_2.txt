1.I have obtained a sample phishing email from "https://blog.usecure.io/the-most-common-examples-of-a-phishing-email" website from google .

2.I have found one of the email phishing example which identify itself as HM Revenue and Customs this email contains The council tax scam
 
  is a particularly frustrating attack, as it can use a variety of clever messages that convince you to part ways with your details.

3. It seemd like a genuiune email address from where the email is recived.

4. From: Hugo Enrique osorio <hugo23 5@hotmail.co uk Date: 18 October 2016 at 13:34:36 BST

   Note: A refund can be delayed a variety of reasons, for example submitting invalid records or applying after deadline.

5. after analysing from online header analyzer which i used is that MX tool box super tools i found nothing as a discrepancies.

6. another thing which i have observed is that:
   
   From the UK Gov website, here are a few more examples of what a fraudulent tax email may contain:

   It insists you’re in the wrong Council Tax band and are owed back payments on your Council Tax bill, when in fact your band is correct;

   It says they’re from the local council or Valuation Office Agency (VOA) and ask for your bank details so they can provide a refund;

   Claim that the VOA charges you to challenge your Council Tax band;

   Claims that taxpayers must, by law, be represented by an agent to challenge their band.

7.There was one suspicious link which is  attached in the mail.

8. The email looks like a urgent call in a professional tone.

9.when user clicked the link it is redirected to another page as it says to cange the password of outlook
  
  End users are encouraged to click the link inside the email, in order to be directed to a legitimate page (i.e., Microsoft)
 
  where they are quickly able to update their password. But, any credentials entered into this page will be sent straight to the cyber criminals at hand. 

10.there was no presence of any spelling or grammatical errors.


Phishing Traits Found in the Email:

1. Impersonation of a Trusted Entity:
   Pretends to be from HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC).

2. Urgent Call-to-Action:
   Urges the recipient to claim a tax refund quickly.

3. Suspicious Sender Address:
   Email sent from a personal Hotmail address (`hugo235@hotmail.co.uk`), not an official HMRC domain.

4. Deceptive Link:
   Contains a link redirecting to a fake Outlook page to steal credentials.

5. Too Good to Be True Offer:
   Promises a refund of £209.27 without any formal verification.

6. Professional Appearance:
   No spelling or grammar mistakes, making it seem legitimate.

7. Credential Theft Attempt:
   Link leads to a fake login page to harvest user credentials.

8. Lack of Personalization:
   Uses generic greeting ("Hello") rather than addressing the recipient by name.
